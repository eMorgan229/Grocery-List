# Grocery list
## User Story
- A user can Login/logout to the app
- A user can CREATE a grocery list
- A user can CREATE a new grocery list item and UPDATE and DELETE an item
- A user can favorite an item that they need frequently 
- ***A user can sort the items into cateogories
- ***A user can create a "household" or group list that can be updated and deleted by multiple  users ( this is a STRETCH goal) achieved by allowing multiple users to send something equivalent to a "friend request" to eachother which would grant them access to admin to both be able to CRUD the same grocery list
- ***A user can add links from favorite recipes and the app will search data in the url and automatically create a grocery list with the ingredients
